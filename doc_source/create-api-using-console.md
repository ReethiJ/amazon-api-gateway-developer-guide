 To set up an API Gateway API using the API Gateway console, see [Build an API with HTTP Custom Integration](api-gateway-create-api-step-by-step.md)\. 

 You can learn how to set up an API by following an example\. For more information, see [Build an API Gateway API from an Example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md)\. 

 Alternatively, you can set up an API by using the API Gateway [Import API](api-gateway-import-api.md) feature to upload an external API definition, such as one expressed in the [Swagger 2\.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) with the [API Gateway Extensions to Swagger](api-gateway-swagger-extensions.md)\. The example provided in [Build an API Gateway API from an Example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md) uses the Import API feature\.
