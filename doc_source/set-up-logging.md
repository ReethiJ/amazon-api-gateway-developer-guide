# Set Up CloudWatch API Logging in API Gateway<a name="set-up-logging"></a>

 To help debug issues related to request execution or client access to your API, you can enable Amazon CloudWatch Logs to log API calls\. Once enabled, API Gateway will log API calls in CloudWatch\. For more information, see [Monitor API execution with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.

## CloudWatch Log Formats for API Gateway<a name="apigateway-cloudwatch-log-formats"></a>

 There are two types of API logging in CloudWatch: execution logging and access logging\. In execution logging, API Gateway manages the CloudWatch Logs\. The process includes creating log groups and log streams, and reporting to the log streams any caller's requests and responses\. The logged data includes errors or execution traces \(such as request or response parameter values or payloads\), data used by Lambda authorizers \(formerly known as custom authorizers\), whether API keys are required, whether usage plans are enabled, and so on\. 

When you deploy an API, API Gateway creates a log group and log streams under the log group\. The log group is named following the `API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{rest-api-id}/{stage_name}` format\. Within each log group, the logs are further divided into log streams, which are ordered by **Last Event Time** as logged data is reported\. 

In access logging, you, as an API developer, want to log who has accessed your API and how the caller accessed the API\. You can create your own log group or choose an existing one, which could be managed by API Gateway\. You can specify the access details by selecting [`$context`](api-gateway-mapping-template-reference.md#context-variable-reference) variables, expressed in a format of your choosing, and by choosing a log group as the destination\. To preserve uniqueness of each log, access log format must include `$context.requestId`\. 

Choose a log format that is also adopted by your analytic backend, such as [Common Log Format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common) \(CLF\), JSON, XML, or CSV\. You can then feed the access logs to it directly to have your metrics computed and rendered\. To define the log format, set the log group ARN on the [accessLogSettings/destinationArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#destinationArn) property on the [stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/)\. You can obtain a log group ARN in the CloudWatch console, provided that the **ARN** column is selected for display\. To define the access log format, set a chosen format on the [accessLogSetting/format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#format) property on the [stage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/)\. 

Examples of some commonly used access log formats are shown in the API Gateway console and listed as follows\.
+ `CLF` \([Common Log Format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common)\):

  ```
  $context.identity.sourceIp $context.identity.caller  \
  $context.identity.user [$context.requestTime] \
  "$context.httpMethod $context.resourcePath $context.protocol" \
  $context.status $context.responseLength $context.requestId
  ```

  The continuation characters \(`\`\) are meant as a visual aid and the log format cannot have any line breaks\.
+  `JSON`: 

  ```
  { "requestId":"$context.requestId", \
    "ip": "$context.identity.sourceIp", \
    "caller":"$context.identity.caller", \
    "user":"$context.identity.user", \
    "requestTime":"$context.requestTime", \
    "httpMethod":"$context.httpMethod", \
    "resourcePath":"$context.resourcePath", \
    "status":"$context.status", \
    "protocol":"$context.protocol", \
    "responseLength":"$context.responseLength" \
  }
  ```

  The continuation characters \(`\`\) are meant as a visual aid and the log format cannot have any line breaks\.
+ `XML`: 

  ```
  <request id="$context.requestId"> \
      <ip>$context.identity.sourceIp</ip> \
      <caller>$context.identity.caller</caller> \
      <user>$context.identity.user</user> \
      <requestTime>$context.requestTime</requestTime> \
      <httpMethod>$context.httpMethod</httpMethod> \
      <resourcePath>$context.resourcePath</resourcePath> \
      <status>$context.status</status> \
      <protocol>$context.protocol</protocol> \
      <responseLength>$context.responseLength</responseLength> \
  </request>
  ```

  The continuation characters \(`\`\) are meant as a visual aid and the log format cannot have any line breaks\.
+ `CSV` \(comma\-separated values\):

  ```
  $context.identity.sourceIp,$context.identity.caller,\
  $context.identity.user,$context.requestTime,$context.httpMethod,\
  $context.resourcePath,$context.protocol,$context.status,\
  $context.responseLength,$context.requestId
  ```

  The continuation characters \(`\`\) are meant as a visual aid and the log format cannot have any line breaks\.

## Permissions for CloudWatch Logging<a name="set-up-access-logging-permissions"></a>

To enable CloudWatch Logs, you must grant API Gateway permission to read and write logs to CloudWatch for your account\. The `AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs` managed policy \(with an ARN of `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonAPIGatewayPushToCloudWatchLogs`\) has all the required permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "logs:GetLogEvents",
                "logs:FilterLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

To grant these permissions to your account, create an IAM role with `apigateway.amazonaws.com` as its trusted entity, attach the preceding policy to the IAM role, and set the IAM role ARN on the [cloudWatchRoleArn](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/account/#cloudWatchRoleArn) property on your [Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/resource/account/)\.

## Set up API Logging Using the API Gateway Console<a name="set-up-access-logging-using-console"></a>

To set up API logging, you must have deployed the API to a stage\. You must also have configured [an appropriate CloudWatch Logs role](#set-up-access-logging-permissions) ARN for your account\. 

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. Choose **Settings** from the primary navigation panel\. Type an ARN of an IAM role with appropriate permissions in **CloudWatch log role ARN**\. You need to do this once\. 

1.  Do one of the following:

   1.  Choose an existing API and then choose a stage\.

   1.  Create an API and deploy it to a stage\.

1.  Choose **Logs/Tracing** in the **Stage Editor**\.

1. To enable execution logging, choose **Enable CloudWatch Logs** under **CloudWatch Settings**\. Choose **Error** or **Info** from the drop\-down menu\. If desired, choose **Enable Detailed CloudWatch Metrics**\.

   For more information about CloudWatch metrics, see [API Gateway Metrics and Dimensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/api-gateway-metrics-dimensions.html#api-gateway-metricdimensions)\.

1. To enable access logging, choose **Enable Access Logging** under **Custom Access Logging**\. Then type the ARN of a log group in **CloudWatch Group**\. Type a log format in **Log Format**\. You can choose **CLF**, **JSON**, **XML**, or **CSV** to use one of the provided examples as a guide\.

1. Choose **Save Changes**\.

**Note**  
You can enable execution logging and access logging independent of each other\.

API Gateway is now ready to log requests to your API\. You do not need to redeploy the API when you update the stage settings, logs, or stage variables\.
