# Generate the Java SDK of an API<a name="generate-java-sdk-of-an-api"></a>

**To generate the Java SDK of an API in API Gateway**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. In the box that contains the name of the API for the stage, choose **Stages**\. 

1. In the **Stages** pane, choose the name of the stage\.

1. On the **SDK Generation** tab, for **Platform**, choose **Java** and do the following:

   1.  For **Service Name**, specify the name of your SDK\. For example, `SimpleCalcSdk`\. This becomes the name of your SDK client class\. The name corresponds to the `<name>` tag under `<project>` in the pom\.xml file, which is in the SDK's project folder\. Do not include hyphens\.

   1.  For **Java Package Name**, specify a package name for your SDK\. For example, `examples.aws.apig.simpleCalc.sdk`\. This package name is used as the namespace of your SDK library\. Do not include hyphens\.

   1.  For **Java Build System**, type `maven` or `gradle` to specify the build system\.

   1.  For **Java Group Id**, type a group identifier for your SDK project\. For example, `my-apig-api-examples`\. This identifier corresponds to the `<groupId>` tag under `<project>` in the `pom.xml` file, which is in the SDK's project folder\.

   1.  For **Java Artifact Id**, type an artifact identifier for your SDK project\. For example, `simple-calc-sdk`\. This identifier corresponds to the `<artifactId>` tag under `<project>` in the `pom.xml` file, which is in the SDK's project folder\.

   1.  For **Java Artifact Version**, type a version identifier string\. For example, `1.0.0`\. This version identifier corresponds to the `<version>` tag under `<project>` in the `pom.xml` file, which is in the SDK's project folder\.

   1. For **Source Code License Text**, type the license text of your source code, if any\.

1. Choose **Generate SDK**, and then follow the on\-screen directions to download the SDK generated by API Gateway\.

1. Follow the instructions in [Use a Java SDK Generated by API Gateway](how-to-call-apigateway-generated-java-sdk.md) to use the generated SDK\.

 Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API and regenerate the SDK to have the updates included\.
