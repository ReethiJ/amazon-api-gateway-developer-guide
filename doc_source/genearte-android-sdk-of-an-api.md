**To generate the Android SDK of an API in API Gateway**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. In the box that contains the name of the API for the stage, choose **Stages**\. 

1. In the **Stages** pane, choose the name of the stage\.

1. On the **SDK Generation** tab, for **Platform**, choose the Android platform\. 

   1.  For **Group ID**, type the unique identifier for the corresponding project\. This is used in the `pom.xml` file \(for example, **com\.mycompany**\)\.

   1.  For **Invoker package**, type the namespace for the generated client classes \(for example, **com\.mycompany\.clientsdk**\)\.

   1.  For **Artifact ID**, type the name of the compiled \.jar file without the version\. This is used in the `pom.xml` file \(for example, **aws\-apigateway\-api\-sdk**\)\.

   1. For **Artifact version**, type the artifact version number for the generated client\. This is used in the `pom.xml` file and should follow a *major*\.*minor*\.*patch* pattern \(for example, **1\.0\.0**\)\.

1. Choose **Generate SDK**, and then follow the on\-screen directions to download the SDK generated by API Gateway\.

1. Follow the instructions in [Use an Android SDK Generated by API Gateway](how-to-generate-sdk-android.md) to use the generated SDK\. 

 Every time you update an API, you must redeploy the API and regenerate the SDK to have the updates included\.
